# PARD Web HW1 Clone Coding Today Home
## Topic
Our first actual assignment is all about clone coding an existing service only by the front-end.

## Skills
I tried to practice and have a detailed revision of 'markup language' including HTML, CSS, Js.
Throughout this project, my goal was to understand and be able to apply the concept of JSX, Components, and Props.
In fact, I managed to apply Components and JSX in my project, but failed to use Props.
One thing I tried in order to use the concept of Props was creating a superior Component that can be used to get different input from the user (for instance, email, password, etc.).
However, I found out that delivering words that should be printed out for each instance through Props somehow does not work.
Thus, I had to create each type of Components in similar form but with different words to be printed.

## IDE
Visual Studio Code
